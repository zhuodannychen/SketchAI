SketchAI is the capstone project of the 2018-19 PWSH Artificial Intelligence Club. 
It uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that was hand-trained by students to recognize hand-drawn sketches. 
The CNN was trained to recognize 100 [classes](https://github.com/zhuodannychen/SketchAI/blob/master/model/class_names.txt)  using the quick draw [dataset](https://github.com/googlecreativelab/quickdraw-dataset). 
It achieves 94% top 5 accuracy with an ultra-light 100k parameter architecture.
